#### Description: CS50 Space is an online application that allows users to view and explore the stunning imagery and data provided by NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) service. Developed using a combination of Flask, Python, HTML, and CSS, this application offers a user-friendly and visually appealing way for users to discover the beauty and mysteries of the universe. To get started with CS50 Space, users must first put the command "export API_KEY=0" into their terminal. This will allow the application to connect to NASA's APOD service and retrieve the latest image and data. Once the application is running, users must register and create a login to access the full range of features and tools. Once logged in, users are presented with the main page, which displays NASA's current Astronomy Picture of the Day. This beautiful and often awe-inspiring image is accompanied by a brief description and explanation, providing users with a deeper understanding of the subject matter. In addition to displaying the current day's APOD, CS50 Space also provides users with the ability to view past APODs by using the built-in date selector. This powerful feature allows users to view APODs from any date dating back to the start of the APOD service in 1995. This means that users can explore the vast archive of images and data provided by NASA, discovering new and fascinating subjects every day. The date selector is simple and intuitive to use, making it easy for users to find and view the APODs that interest them the most. As new APODs are released by NASA, CS50 Space will automatically update to display the latest image and data. This means that users can visit the site on a regular basis to see the latest and most fascinating images and data from our universe. Whether you are interested in exploring the depths of space, learning about the latest discoveries in astrophysics, or simply marveling at the beauty of the cosmos, CS50 Space has something for everyone. Developing CS50 Space was a challenging and rewarding experience for me. I went back and forth on many project ideas for a while. It required a lot of thought and planning to determine the best way to implement the desired features and tools. Connecting to NASA's APOD API proved to be a particular challenge, as I had to experiment with different methods and approaches in order to get it to work correctly. I attempted it multiple times in python and in javascript. Once the connection was established, I had to figure out how to display the data in HTML in a visually appealing and user-friendly way. The idea of the date selector and the ability to view past APODs was a key feature of the application, and one that required careful thought and planning to implement. I didn't think of it until after I was done. I also drew upon experience with the finance project in week 9 to successfully implement a login system and build the structure of the Flask program. Overall, the process of creating CS50 Space was a valuable learning experience that helped me expand my knowledge and skills in web development.
